     You must include a copy of this License in any distribution of the Software
     or a Derivative Work, in Source Code or Object Code form.

4.2. Attribution

     expressly notifies You otherwise in writing.

8.4. Termination of this License shall not affect the rights of any third
     parties who received the Software or Derivative Works from You under this

      Licensor concerning the Software, and supersedes any prior agreements
      or understandings regarding the Software.

11.2. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, that

11.3. No failure or delay by the Licensor in exercising any right under this
      License shall be deemed a waiver of that right.

      any conflict-of-laws rules that would result in the application of
      another jurisdiction's laws.
